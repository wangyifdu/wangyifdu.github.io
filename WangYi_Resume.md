Graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees. I have extensive experience in software security analysis, system development, and now LLM applications. I'm a research assistant at Fudan University's Institute of Big Data, I focus on cutting-edge security research including smart vulnerability detection, advanced fuzz testing techniques and system emulation. A significant portion of my work involves applying LLMs to cybersecurity challenges and cross-disciplinary applications, where I've developed and deployed multiple LLM-powered solutions for industry partners and research institutions. 

## Research
- Software Security. Program analysis, vulnerability detection, fuzzing test. (including blockchain security, smart contract fuzzing)
- System Simulation. Running firmware for embedded systems.
- AI assisted security enhancement. Agent/MCP security. Cloud security.


## Projects
